# 🔐 ProtonVPN: Setup and Usage

> This lab introduced me to the concept of secure internet browsing using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). I explored VPN technology by setting up ProtonVPN on both my local computer and an Azure-hosted virtual machine, allowing me to test IP address changes, geo-based browsing experiences, and encrypted traffic routing across different locations.

## 🧰 Skills & Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free version)  
- Windows 10 (local machine & Azure VM)  
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)  
- Public IP Verification (`whatismyipaddress.com`)

## 🌍 Lab Objectives

### 🌐 VPN Configuration
Installed and logged into ProtonVPN across two environments — my local system and a Windows 10 VM in Azure. Chose different geographic servers to route traffic securely.

### 🧭 IP Address Testing
Verified how VPNs mask public IP addresses and tested browsing experience differences across regions (e.g., Japan, Netherlands, etc.). Checked DNS/IP changes on sites like Google, Disney, and Amazon.

### 🔎 Network Behavior Observation
Compared IP data before and after VPN activation. Noted how location-based content changed depending on the VPN server used. Practiced secure tunneling from cloud-based environments and personal devices.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
✅ VPNs effectively hide your public IP and encrypt network traffic  
✅ Using VPNs from different environments (local & cloud) broadens understanding of secure networking  
✅ Web services adjust content based on geolocation — useful for security professionals, testers, and travelers  
✅ Real-world VPN use strengthens digital privacy and opens the door to learning advanced network security tools
